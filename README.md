🧠 DumbBot — The Smartest Dumb Bot You'll Ever Met

Meet DumbBot. It has no brain cells, but somehow, it’s running the show.

Every 10 minutes, DumbBot pops in with a "dumbest of the dumb" yes/no question like:
🧼 “If I microwave ice, will I get fire?”

Answer with /yes or /no, and pray to the RNG gods because DumbBot decides what’s right — randomly. 😂

Get it right? +1 point.
Get it wrong? You're still dumb, but you're not alone.
Try answering twice? “@you got temporary memory loss.” 🧠💀

Compete with your friends to become the #1 certified dummy on the /dumbboard.
No intelligence required — just vibes.

DumbBot: Because thinking is overrated. 🫠
## How It Works

- Every 10 minutes, DumbBot posts a random yes/no dumb question in the channel.  
- Users answer with `/yes` or `/no`.  
- DumbBot randomly selects the “correct” answer and awards 1 point to users who answered correctly.  
- Users trying to answer the same question twice get a funny “@user got temporary memory loss” message.  
- Use `/dumbboard` to see who’s the dumbest/
